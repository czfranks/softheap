The Soft Heap data structure is the backbone of the (theoretically) fastest minimum spanning tree algorithm known. It can also be used to implement selection, median finding, and to do approximate sorting.

This project attempts to provide good implementations of the Soft Heap so that such algorithms can be benchmarked.
